# Fractional Wrapper
Project #4 for Arcane x CertiK Developer Workshop: https://calnix.gitbook.io/eth-dev/ <br>
Problem Statement: https://github.com/yieldprotocol/mentorship2022/issues/4

## Objectives
* Users can send a pre-specified erc-20 token (underlying) to an ERC20 contract(Fractional Wrapper).
* Fractional Wrapper contract issues a number of Wrapper tokens to the sender, equal to the deposit multiplied by a fractional number, called exchange rate. Exchange rate is set by the contract owner.
* This number is in the range of [0, 1e18], and available in increments of 10**-27. (ray).
* At any point, a holder of Wrapper tokens can burn them to recover an amount of underlying equal to the amount of Wrapper tokens burned, divided by the exchange rate.
* This Fractional Wrapper can conform to the [ERC4626 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626). 

### Process
* User sends DAI to FWrapper.
* User receives wDAI, (wDAI = DAI * ex_rate)
* Exchange rate set by FWrapper owner
* Ex_rate has decimal precision of 10**27 precision
* User can liquidate and get back underlying DAI, (wDAI is burnt) ---> dai_qty = wDAI/ex_rate

### Contracts
1. DAIToken - underlying
2. FractionalWrapper - "vault w/ ex_rate" 
3. Ownable.sol - for onlyOwner modifier, applied on setExchangeRate

Both contracts are ERC20Mock, to issue tokens. 
FractionalWrapper must conform to ERC4626 specifications.
- All methods must be implemented
- Implementation of convert* and preview* will be identical in this case (no need to calculate some time-weighted average for convert*).
